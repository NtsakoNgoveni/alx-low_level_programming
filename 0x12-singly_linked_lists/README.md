ALX singly linked list task. In this directory I build programs relating to singly-linked list.

1.  a function that prints all the elements of a list-t list.
2. a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list-t list.
3. a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list-t list.
4.  a function that adds a new node at the end of a list-t list.
5. a function that frees a list-t list.
